# c4c-test-chrome-extension 

<p>This chrome extension is a technique that the Code for Canada team at the National Energy Board is using to visualise and test design changes on the <a href="https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/">REGDOCs</a> website in real time. This is useful because: </p>

<p>No access is required to the websites source files to test ideas<br>
The extension shares assets with the page, so matching styling is easy<br>
It allows one to visualise a demo or feature as if it were in production<br>
Saves html and css as we test prototypes internally and within an open source environment,  Github. <br>
Creates a version history of each prototype </p>

<p>There are, however, many other applications for this type of extension, such as modifying the styling of a website, hiding an annoying element, auto-populating a form, or clicking something on page load--we are exploring this as we see fit.</p>
 
<p><strong>tl:dr this is our front-end design playground for the <a href="https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/">National Energy Board's regulatory database</a></strong></p>
