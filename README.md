# c4c-test-chrome-extension 

<p>This chrome extension is a technique that we can use to visualise how design changes would look and work on a website in real time. This is useful because: </p>

<p>No access is required to the websites source files
The extension shares assets with the page, so matching styling is easy 
It allows one to visualise a demo or feature as if it were in production 
Saves html and css as we test prototypes internally and within an open source environment,  Github. 
Version history</p>

<p>There are, however, many other applications for this type of extension, such as modifying the styling of a website, hiding an annoying element, auto-populating a form, or clicking something on page load--we can explore this as we see fit.</p>
