# c4c-test-chrome-extension 

<p>This chrome extension is a technique that the Code for Canada team at the National Energy Board is using to visualise and test how design changes on the REGDOCs website in real time. This is useful because: </p>

<p>No access is required to the websites source files
The extension shares assets with the page, so matching styling is easy 
It allows one to visualise a demo or feature as if it were in production 
Saves html and css as we test prototypes internally and within an open source environment,  Github. 
Version history</p>

<p>There are, however, many other applications for this type of extension, such as modifying the styling of a website, hiding an annoying element, auto-populating a form, or clicking something on page load--we are exploring this as we see fit.</p>
