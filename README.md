# c4c-test-chrome-extension 

<p>This chrome extension is a technique that the Code for Canada team at the National Energy Board is using to visualise and test design changes on the REGDOCs website in real time. This is useful because: </p>

<p>No access is required to the websites source files to test ideas<br>
The extension shares assets with the page, so matching styling is easy<br>
It allows one to visualise a demo or feature as if it were in production<br>
Saves html and css as we test prototypes internally and within an open source environment,  Github. <br>
Creates a version history of each prototype </p>

<p>There are, however, many other applications for this type of extension, such as modifying the styling of a website, hiding an annoying element, auto-populating a form, or clicking something on page load--we are exploring this as we see fit.</p>
 
<p>tl:dr this is our front-end design playground for the National Energy Board's regulatory database: https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/. </p>
